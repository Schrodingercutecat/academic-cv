Weiheng Tang is an undergraduate in physics department at Peking(Beijing) University. His research interests include physics-informd machine learning and inverse problem as well as algorithms for optical, biological, and robotic systems. He also cares about the impact that different imaging techniques may have on the biotech and healthcare industries. Currently, I work under Dr. Roarke Horstmeyer at the Duke Computational Optics Lab as a visiting student.
